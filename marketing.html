                        I have made both cooperative and executive decisions for multiple organizations regarding:<br>
                        - Which shows to attend<br>
                        - What kind of events to produce<br>

                        - How to go about planning for the events from the ground-up.<br><br>I am good at thinking about tangential benefits/detriments and I am good at helping facilitate these decisions in pretty much any kind of environment.</p>

                          <p>I have done this in many different industries, styles, countries, sizes and budgets for nearly twenty years.<br><br>

                          This can include details and decisions such as:<br>
                          - Selection of which shows to attend (or which events to create)<br>
                          - Selection of booth space in venue(s)<br>
                          - Sourcing/negotiating/procuring venues/locations for events<br>
                          - Planning booth layout (or event map)<br>
                          - Working out the logistics of what to ship or buy on site<br>
                          - Thinking-through, budgeting and timelining for event rental/hiring/purchasing needs (toilets, trash, chairs, stage, lighting, sound system, security, bartenders, keg delivery, ice, serving glasses/plates/cutlery, hosts, cones, signage, negotiating with live bands, etc).<br><br>

                          I've conceived, planned, designed, sought vendors and sold spaces to "farmers market" type events<br><br>

                          I've conceived, planned, designed, bought gear, setup enormous events in difficult locations, recruited/scheduled and managed over 50 volunteers at once, made friends with local sheriffs and helped clean-up after thousands of people.<br><br>

                          I've made dozens of complex maps of venues, stand blueprints, staff assignment posts, parking areas, power points, distribution of all event facilities and people-flow.<br><br>

                          This is something I am very good at (and really enjoy), and I am happy to provide references (you can start with Brooklyn if you like ;) )<br>

                          From selection of which shows to attend (or which events to create), to selection of booth space in venue(s), to sourcing locations for events, to planning booth layout (or event map), to working out the logistics of what to ship or buy on site, to thinking-through, budgeting and timelining for event rental/hiring needs (toilets, trash, chairs, stage, lighting, sound system, security, bartenders, keg delivery, ice, serving glasses/plates/cutlery, hosts, cones, signage, negotiating with live bands, etc).<br><br>

                          I've conceived, planned, designed, sought vendors and sold spaces to "farmers market" type events.<br><br>

                          I've made dozens of complex maps of venues, stand blueprints, staff assignment posts, parking areas, power points, distribution of all event facilities and people-flow.<br><br>
