                          <p>I've hired, managed and replaced vendors, employees and even customers across a range of industries and situations.<br><br>

                          When terminating working relationships, I have always dealt with these matters personally, and never emotionally. I always try to handle such unfortunate occurrences tactfully, professionally and firmly.<br><br>

                          I believe that hiring the best people is critical to success in any business.<br><br>

                          Taking care of your team is critical to your team taking care of you.<br><br>

                          Replacing employees that are not right for the role or the company is also critical to team success and morale.

                          Creating a good job description is critical to finding the right person for a job, and I consider myself quite good at this. The right job description can save a lot of time and frustration.<br><br>

                          My process starts with determining the skillsets, levels of experience and personality fit needed, then writing the description with the correct amount of detail and in the correct voice.

                          <p>Matching the right account manager with the right client is critical to creating a happy client. This can be tricky, and must be handled delicately, and I would take a great deal of care in this task.<br><br>

                          My process would be to find a balance between relationship fit and workload responsibilities - sometimes you can't put your first choice of account manager with a client, and pulling someone from an existing job and stable customer relationship can be very damaging to all involved.

                          I don't believe in passing the buck or throwing people under the bus to save one's own skin. If I make a mistake, I own it.<br><br>

                          I am the kind of leader that is very loyal to my team, and I always do everything in my power to ensure their success, even if that means pitching-in and helping with tasks that are not strictly in my job description.

                          A good leader is always listening.<br><br>

                          If there are consistent pain points arising, it's always a good idea to explore options for improvement. Sometimes there may be no immediate or practical solution, but I believe strongly in finding better ways to do things.<br><br>

                          It's also wise to talk and listen to the people on the front lines and ask for their input, because they usually have relevant information and insights, and might have the best solutions.

                          I would like to see this done largely as a team, with me as the facilitator.<br><br>

                          Letting a team create their own goals and plan their own processes is a great way to encourage ownership and accountability.<br><br>

                          I also like to keep communication going continuously so that there are no surprises when it comes to goal achievement, and if process changes need to be made they can be made as soon as possible.<br>

                          I don't take myself too seriously, and I'd like to see an environment where the team works hard and well, but at the same time are able to have fun, enjoy their jobs and have time to enjoy their lives outside of work as well.
